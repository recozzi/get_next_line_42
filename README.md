<h1>Get Next Line</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The project involves implementing a function in the C programming language that reads one line at a time from a file descriptor. The challenge lies in efficiently managing memory and addressing various conditions. A key aspect is optimizing the buffer size, which denotes the amount of data read in each read operation. Optimizing the buffer size is crucial for maximizing efficiency and minimizing memory usage. The function should be capable of reading and returning lines from different file descriptors, handling complex scenarios such as managing multiple newline characters or reaching the end of a file.
